DWIS Testing Procedures 

# Scraping



# Interpolation
We are implementing two interpolation methods: Nearest neighbor, and inverse linear distance. These two methods will be implemented in java by pulling our scrpaed data out of prometheus, processing it, and then returning a new continuous data set back. From there Grafana will take over in the dashboard generated from the java program. 

We can unit test our interpolation methods by inserting dummy data that we know what the outcome should be provided our program runs as expected.
